# Simple Algolia App

## Description

### This is a Simple Algolio App using NextJS with typescript and Algolia search.
### Need to create an account with Algolia and setup an application with few rules.

#### The dot env file contains the configuration for the app.

>GITHUB_ID=YOUR_GITHUB_ID
GITHUB_SECRET=YOUR_GITHUB_SECRET
ALGOLIA_ADMIN_API_KEY=YOUR_ALGOLIA_ADMIN_API_KEY
ALGOLIA_APPLICATION_ID=YOUR_ALGOLIA_APPLICATION_ID
NEXT_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_AUTH_SECRET=YOUR_NEXT_AUTH_SECRET 

*YOUR_NEXT_AUTH_SECRET* can be generated by entering the following command
in the terminal:

>openssl rand -base64 32


It is not recommended to expose API Keys on the website. Since, this is a POC I took the liberty to use a test api key to preload.
